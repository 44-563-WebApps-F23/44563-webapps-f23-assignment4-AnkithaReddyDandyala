        <b>BERTA.</b><br>


        [Also softly.] I told you so, Miss. Remember how late the steamboat got
        in last night. And then, when they got home!--good Lord, what a lot the
        young mistress had to unpack before she could get to bed.
        <br><br>

        <b>MISS TESMAN.</b><br>

        Well well--let them have their sleep out. But let us see that they get a
        good breath of the fresh morning air when they do appear.<br>

        [She goes to the glass door and throws it open.

        <br><br>

        <b>BERTA.</b><br>

        [Beside the table, at a loss what to do with the bouquet in her hand.]
        I declare there isn't a bit of room left. I think I'll put it down here,
        Miss. [She places it on the piano.
        <br><br>

        <b>MISS TESMAN.</b><br>

        So you've got a new mistress now, my dear Berta. Heaven knows it was a
        wrench to me to part with you.
        <br><br>

        <b>BERTA.</b><br>

        [On the point of weeping.] And do you think it wasn't hard for me, too,
        Miss? After all the blessed years I've been with you and Miss Rina.(1)
        <br><br>

        <b>MISS TESMAN.</b><br>

        We must make the best of it, Berta. There was nothing else to be done.
        George can't do without you, you see-he absolutely can't. He has had you
        to look after him ever since he was a little boy.
        <br><br>

        <b>BERTA.</b><br>

        Ah but, Miss Julia, I can't help thinking of Miss Rina lying helpless
        at home there, poor thing. And with only that new girl too! She'll never
        learn to take proper care of an invalid.
